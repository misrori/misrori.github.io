# Teaching

## Central European University (CEU) Economics Department
#### I have experience teaching in a higher education setting, at CEU in the MSc in Business Analytics program. I currently teach two courses; one focused on R programming, where I cover topics such as Github integration, data transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Additionally, I teach students how to use Rmarkdown with different themes to create visually appealing assignments. In my second course, I teach web scraping and how to parse HTML, work with APIs, and automate browser actions using Selenium. Overall, I am skilled in teaching programming and data analysis related topics, and have experience creating curriculum and delivering engaging lectures.
