# About Me

##### I am a highly motivated and skilled data analyst and programmer with a background in R development. I have 5 years of professional experience working at OTP, where I gained expertise in statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. In addition to my work in R, I am also proficient in Python and am always looking for opportunities to expand my skillset.

##### Outside of my work in data analysis, I am passionate about stock and crypto trading and have a strong interest in big data and its potential applications. I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and am always looking for ways to use my skills to make data-driven decisions.

##### In addition to my professional pursuits, I am also an experienced teacher and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I currently teach webscraping at CEU and find great satisfaction in helping others learn and grow.
